# operations on variables:

1. To get the id of a variable we use id(variable name)
2. Assigning var1 to var2:
    a = 10
    b = a
   Now if we find the id of a and b....we will get the same value , that's mean a and b are both pointing to the same object i.e, 10
3. To find the data type of a variable we use type() functions.
   for ex. type(a) will give 'int' as an output
   
# In python we cannot convert a variable into a constant.
